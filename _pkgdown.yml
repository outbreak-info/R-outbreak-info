- title: "SARS-CoV-2 Variant Prevalence"
  desc: >
    Functions to track SARS-CoV-2 variant prevalence worldwide, by country,
    by state/province, or by U.S. county. All sequence data is provided by
    [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/). Note that these functions require free
    **[registration with GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/registration/register/)**, and 
    you'll need to call `authenticateUser()` at the start of each session.

- title: "Research Library"
  desc: >
    Functions to track metadata of COVID-19 publications, clinical trials, datasets, protocols, and more. 
    Note that unlike the variant prevalence functions, these functions **do not require a GISAID account**
    or a call to `authenticateUser()`to use them.

- title: "Cases & Deaths"
  desc: >
    Functions to track COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, by country,
    by state/province, or by U.S. county. All epidemiological data is provided by
    the [Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
    at Johns Hopkins University
    and the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).  Note that unlike the variant prevalence functions, these functions **do not require a GISAID account**
    or a call to `authenticateUser()` to use them.
